## 5.0.0 (2020-08-22)

This update fixes a hidden but long-standing problem. Because the problem rarely occurs in low version system, and the existing settings are not affected after upgrading to Android, this problem was surfaced recently. A typical example is, in Android 10, once you have changed location permission from the system, changes in older versions of App Ops will never work (even if it seems to be changed successfully).

This contains a lot of work behind, please read [technical details](./guide/technical/system_behaviors/).

**What you should to know:**

- What you see or change in App Ops now reflects the final status
- "Deny" in older versions is renamed to "Ignore"
- Old backups are no longer supported because they lack the necessary information (they may even contain wrong information)
- For Delegated Device Admin mode, currently, only Island v5.0+ has the support of new required APIs
- For Delegated Device Admin mode, part of the backup is from historical user actions, this is because admin apps does not have enough permission to get the accurate status (this is system limitation)

Other changes:

- Template: any options can be used in the template
- Backup: more flexibility when restoring
- Usage monitor: attempt to reduce "wrong" reports (sometimes the systems always reports app is using "location" even if the app is not running)
- Usage monitor & Clipboard monitor: add "exclude system apps" option

## 4.2.2 (2020-07-16)

  Get notified when apps are using location, camera or microphone

## 4.1.1 (2020-07-10)

- Clipboard monitor: temporary access time is now optionable
- Clipboard monitor: fix a UI issue of "Excluded apps"
- Fix the problem that on Android 10+, the backup created after v4.0.0 may be broken
- Correctly report the error from DPM mode
- Temporarily not to use resource optimization feature from AAPT2, maybe this could solve the problem of random settings crash happens on some users

- Clipboard monitor: add "Window position" and "Excluded apps" option

## 4.0.0 (2020-07-04)

<sub><b>ã€”1ã€•</b>Exclude apps from the monitor will come in the next version</sub>
<br><sub><b>ã€”2ã€•</b>Previously, the name of "the permission" is used in priority. But as Android changes some permission name across versions, the name is more and more inaccurate.</sub>
<br><sub><b>ã€”3ã€•</b>Due to user reports, some old Samsung devices "appear to have this feature", but change to "ask" will cause the system unable to boot.</sub>
